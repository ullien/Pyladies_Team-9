## Capstone Instructions ##

- [x] 1. **Find a dataset** that has at least 2 CSV files (to merge/join/concat them later)    
     * Life expectancy: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
     * Covid-19: https://www.kaggle.com/nxpnsv/country-health-indicators
     * BCG vaccine: https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.80500
     * Worldometers Covid-19 data from 31.05.20: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/


- [x] 2. Come up with *5 questions* that you want to answer while exploring the dataset
     * Do countries with higher life expectancy suffer more from Covid-19 in terms of deaths recorded?
     * Do countries where BCG vaccine was widely implemented have fewer infection rates per million?
     * Do countries where BCG vaccine was widely implemented have higher life expectancy? 
     * What is the most Covid-19 affected continent in terms of infected cases and deaths?
     * What country has the highest ratio of recovered cases?
     
     
- [x] 3. Create one **GitHub repository** for your team Capstone project                                                                 
(Thank you Daniela for taking care of this!)

- [x] 4. **Perform EDA** (Exploratoty Data Analysis) on your dataset with basic visualisations  
(Useful source: https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python-c9a77dfa39ce)

- [x] 5. **Make a 5 min presentation** about your team findings and be ready to present it online. Add presentation slides to your GitHub repo.  
(We do not need to present the code. Just the findings and the story behind it. Although organisers mentioned that if we post code in this repo, then we get a feedback)
